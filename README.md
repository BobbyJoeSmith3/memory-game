## Description

A simple game of memory. Find matching pairs of cards by flipping them over. If they match, then you've found a pair, otherwise the cards flip back over and you have to try to guess where the matching pairs might be. Find all card pairs to win the game, with extra style points given to speed and efficiency.

## Objectives

+ Game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
+ When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
+ A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
+ The game displays a star rating (from 1-3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it should display 3 stars. After some number of moves, it should change to a 2 star rating. After a few more moves, it should change to a 1 star rating.
+ When the player starts a game, a displayed timer should also start. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
+ Game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
+ Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting as described in the [Udacity JavaScript Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html)
+ Utilize performant javascript code.
